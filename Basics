1.User Agent StyleSheets: Contain browser defaults for styles, these get the lowest level of precedence.
2. User Stylesheets: Contain user preference saved in the browser, which override user agent stylesheets.
3.Author Stylesheets: Contains the CSS Code  we write, these get the highest level of precedence(assuming !important has not been used)
